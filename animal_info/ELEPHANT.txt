Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth, you can tell what animal an elephant by their large bodies, large ears and tusks is. There are only three living species of elephant left in the world, two African species and one Asian species, these are the African Savannah Elephant, the African Forest Elephant and the Asian Elephant. Of these three species there are many sub-species that are a little too similar to be completely different species.  Elephant numbers have been falling significantly for many years now, their tusks contain ivory that is a popular illegal trade amongst humans. Due to this they have been hunted for many years, and just in the recent years 200,000 elephants are killed each year for their tusks.
