The Domestic dog is a descendant of the wolf and is the most common household pet. You can see dogs almost everywhere you go, out for walks or playing fetch, dogs have been dubbed “Man’s best friend”. Dogs were one of the first domesticated animals evidence pointing that they were used as hunting buddies or bodyguards to people in the early days of domestication. Even now dogs are not just friends but can be used for protection and help just like when they were previously domesticated. Dogs are used as service animals for the blind or disabled, for police work, or for herding on farms. They are insanely helpful as well as loving.
